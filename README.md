# CurrencyServicePractice
This is for Spring Boot practice purposes. 
Two services made specifically for currency exchange and conversion.
Using api-gateway and a naming server, all of which are connected through Spring Cloud config server and EUREKA.
Feign and resilience4j frameworks are also used to lower the amount of boiler-plate code and have more control over HTTP calls from client-side.
This version uses H2 in memory database for practice purpose.
